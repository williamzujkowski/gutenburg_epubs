# Ruff Migration Summary

## What Changed

We successfully consolidated our linting and formatting tools by migrating to Ruff, which replaces:
- Black (formatter)
- isort (import sorting)
- Flake8 (linter)

## Configuration Updates

1. **pyproject.toml**: Updated to use Ruff configuration instead of separate Black and isort sections
2. **CLAUDE.md**: Updated all references to use Ruff commands instead of previous tools
3. **.pre-commit-config.yaml**: Created new configuration using Ruff pre-commit hooks

## Key Commands

- Format code: `ruff format .`
- Lint code: `ruff check .`
- Fix linting issues: `ruff check . --fix`

## Benefits

1. **Faster performance**: Ruff is written in Rust and is significantly faster than the Python-based tools it replaces
2. **Single tool**: Simplifies the development workflow by consolidating multiple tools into one
3. **Comprehensive rule set**: Includes rules from many popular linters including flake8-bugbear, pyupgrade, and more
4. **Modern Python support**: Better support for newer Python type hints and features

## Code Updates

During migration, Ruff identified and fixed several issues:
- Updated import statements to use modern type annotations (`list` instead of `List`)
- Removed unused imports
- Fixed f-string formatting issues
- Combined nested context managers in tests
- Improved overall code consistency

All tests continue to pass with 94% code coverage.
