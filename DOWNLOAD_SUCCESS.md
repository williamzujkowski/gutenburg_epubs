# Success! 95 Books Downloaded

## Summary
We successfully downloaded **95 books** from Project Gutenberg, totaling approximately **38 MB**.

## How We Did It
After finding that the database-based approach was not working (even after importing the catalog), we implemented a direct download method that:

1. Uses a predefined list of popular book IDs from Project Gutenberg
2. Constructs direct EPUB download URLs for each book
3. Downloads the books directly from the Gutenberg servers

## Downloaded Books
The collection includes classic works like:
- Frankenstein
- Moby Dick
- Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
- The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
- Pride and Prejudice
- The Great Gatsby
- War and Peace
- Dracula
- The Complete Works of William Shakespeare
- Many more classic titles

## Technical Solution
The solution that worked was to bypass the database format URL limitations by:

1. Maintaining a hardcoded list of popular book IDs
2. Using the pattern `https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/{book_id}.epub` to download directly
3. Using the smart downloader's resume and tracking capabilities for reliability

## Next Steps
To download a full 300 books, you could:

1. Extend the list of book IDs in the `popular_ids` array in the `direct_download_top_books` function
2. Run the script again to download additional books
3. Consider implementing a crawler that automatically discovers more book IDs

## Conclusion
While importing the catalog data was successful (60,489 books imported), the format URL information was missing, preventing downloads through the database query method. The direct download approach proved to be a reliable alternative, successfully downloading 95 books in seconds.
