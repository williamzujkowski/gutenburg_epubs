## Remaining Phase

### ðŸ”² Phase 6: Documentation and Finalization
1. Write comprehensive README.md with:
   - Project overview and features
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples for all CLI commands
   - API documentation
   - Performance comparison (sync vs async)
   - Contributing guidelines

2. Create API documentation:
   - Document all public classes and methods
   - Add more comprehensive docstrings where needed
   - Generate API docs using Sphinx or similar

3. Performance testing and benchmarks:
   - Compare sync vs async performance
   - Test with various concurrency levels
   - Document optimal settings

4. Final code review and cleanup:
   - Remove any debug code
   - Ensure consistent code style
   - Add any missing type hints
   - Optimize for production use

5. Package for distribution:
   - Create setup.py
   - Prepare for PyPI release (optional)
   - Create release notes

## Test Coverage

Current test coverage: **84%**
- 117 tests passing
- All modules have comprehensive test coverage
- Type checking passes (mypy)
- Linting passes (ruff)

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.12
- Key libraries: httpx, beautifulsoup4, tqdm, aiofiles
- Testing: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-benchmark
